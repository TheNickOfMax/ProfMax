## Contributing

Once you've pulled the repo and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), you can start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

After that you can branch -> commit -> push -> pull request. Any contribution is appreciated.
