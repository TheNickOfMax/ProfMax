# JobTrail

A job-recommendation testing website, powered by [`svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte). It is currently a school project on a really early stage of development.

## Contributing

Once you've pulled the repo and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

After that you can branch -> commit -> push -> pull request. Usual stuff. Any contribution appriciated.

## Building

To create a production version of JobTrail:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
